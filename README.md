### Data structures
Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees. Don’t forget to include them in your header file.

*Basic Binary Tree*

```
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
```

*Binary Search Tree*

```typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;```

*AVL Tree*

```typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;```

*Max Binary Heap*

```typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;```
